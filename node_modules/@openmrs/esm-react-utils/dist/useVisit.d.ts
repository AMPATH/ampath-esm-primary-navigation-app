/**
 * This React hook returns visit information if the patient UUID is not null. There are
 * potentially two relevant visits at a time: "active" and "current".
 *
 * The active visit is the most recent visit without an end date. The presence of an active
 * visit generally means that the patient is in the facility.
 *
 * The current visit is the active visit, unless a retrospective visit has been selected.
 * If there is no active visit and no selected retrospective visit, then there is no
 * current visit. If there is no active visit but there is a retrospective visit, then
 * the retrospective visit is the current visit. `currentVisitIsRetrospective` tells you
 * whether the current visit is a retrospective visit.
 *
 * The active visit and current visit require two separate API calls. `error` contains
 * the error from either one, if there is an error. `isValidating` is true if either
 * API call is in progress. `mutate` refreshes the data from both API calls.
 *
 * @param patientUuid Unique patient identifier `string`
 * @param representation The custom representation of the visit
